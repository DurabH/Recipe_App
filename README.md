# recipe_app

Dart based Recipe_App made just to serve customers.


## Getting Started

The main purpose of this app is to serve customers with the recipes of some common cooking items.
As it is just basic implementation, so it consists of only 8 recipes so far. 
But for understanding the basic concept and implementation of dart, this app is a good example.
